.. vhh_stc documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed May  6 18:41:33 2020.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Package Overview
================

The following list give an overview of the folder structure of this python repository:

*name of repository*: vhh_stc

   * **ApiSphinxDocumentation/**: includes all files to generate the documentation as well as the created documentations (html, pdf)
   * **config/**: this folder includes the required configuration file
   * **stc/**: this folder represents the shot-type-classification module and builds the main part of this repository
   * **Demo/**: this folder includes a demo script to demonstrate how the package have to be used in customized applications
   * **Develop/**: includes scripts to train and evaluate the pytorch models. Furthermore, a script is included to create the package documentation (pdf, html)
   * **README.md**: this file gives a brief description of this repository (e.g. link to this documentation)
   * **requirements.txt**: this file holds all python lib dependencies and is needed to install the package in your own virtual environment
   * **setup.py**: this script is needed to install the stc package in your own virtual environment

Setup  instructions
===================

This package includes a setup.py script and a requirements.txt file which are needed to install this package for custom applications.
The following instructions have to be done to used this library in your own application:

Requirements:

   * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
   * CUDA 10.1 + cuDNN
   * python version 3.6.x

Create a virtual environment:

   * create a folder to a specified path (e.g. /xxx/vhh_stc/)
   * python3 -m venv /xxx/vhh_stc/

Activate the environment:

   * source /xxx/vhh_stc/bin/activate

Checkout vhh_stc repository to a specified folder:

   * git clone https://github.com/dahe-cvl/vhh_stc

Install the stc package and all dependencies:

   * change to the root directory of the repository (includes setup.py)
   * python setup.py install

.. note::

  You can check the success of the installation by using the commend *pip list*. This command should give you a list with all installed python packages and it should include *vhh_stc*

.. note::

   Currently there is an issue in the *setup.py* script. Therefore the pytorch libraries have to be installed manually by running the following command:
   *pip install torch==1.5.0+cu101 torchvision==0.6.0+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html*

Dataset Generator
=================

In the *Develop/dataset_annotation_scripts* helper scripts are included to generate a annotated dataset to train
a the classification model.

** annotationToolShotTypes_v2.py **

   This script provides a simple frame player GUI to iterate over the frames included in a specified folder. Moreover,
   each frame can be annotated with a simple keyboard command to configured class names. The keyboard commands are
   explained in the script and a configuration section is placed at the beginning of the script. This tool can also be
   used in Windows by executing the batch script (python 3.6.x with opencv is required).

** extractAnnotatedFrames.py **

   After the annotation process is finished (result: xxx.csv file including frame ID and class_name) this script can be
   used to extract all annotated frames.

** showAnnotatedFrames.py **

   This script is used to step through all annotated frames.
